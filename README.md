# Main Plan

- Mottif: Focus News | Moral Outlook On Real Issues.
- Inspiration: There are a lot of social issues around the world, and especially so in smaller and lesser known countries, that never come to the light of attention of people that may have some deep connection with the issue, such as with many children of immigrants from countries outside of the United States that find themselves disconnected with the occurances and the events in their country of origin. This news application is meant to bridge that gap and make it much less of a hassle on the part of the user to find the news that they would need to discover more news about that specific event or event, whilst also providing a more focused and more 'active' outlook on the issue; spurring the people who are interested in these events to promote and actively rally for these issues with a way to set - up community meetups that would help with pushing these issues. Our inspo came from the news of multiple news outlets that would copy and paste the same news that they deem news worthy, where somewhwre, a country out there could be in mortal danger.
